# Description

lenaked is a perl gtk program for interactively adding nikkud to Hebrew text originally written in 2007. It uses a database of various nikkud options that were scan from a corpus. The current database in nikud-db.utf was scanned from the open version of the bible. This has the disadvantage that there are various options used today that are not available in this database.
